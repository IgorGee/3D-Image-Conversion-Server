3D Image Conversion Server
======

A node server that powers the [Carbonizr](https://github.com/IgorGee/Carbonizr "Carbonizr") app.

It transforms images into 3D models that can be rendered on an Android device and 3D printed.

3D models are generated by the [ShapeJS](shapejs.shapeways.com "ShapeJS") API.

Also uses LibGDX's [fbx-conv](https://github.com/libgdx/fbx-conv "LibGDX fbx-conv") and [Blender](https://www.blender.org) to process the models.
